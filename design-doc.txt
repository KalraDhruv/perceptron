Design Document (Perceptron)
Each input consisting of any n dimensions is going to be stored in each column of the matrix.
Each row corresponds to some feature of the given data.
The initial weight would be initialized randomly and adjusted using the following algorithm:
weights += learning_rate * error * input
The function used in perceptron is a step function which makes any positive number 1 and negative number 0.
Following this the problem should converge.
